# Gad-zucks! An appointment and contact manager

_Do you have too many friends?_

_Worried you might forget some of their names and/or contact details?_

_Don't have a phone?_

**Well, look no further than this electrified bonified Reactified event and contact planner!**

## Gee mister, how will I remember it's Bill's Birthday on Thursday?

Well Timmy, look no further than this here planner here, all you have to do is enter the details and through the power of modern technology this here application will remember it for you. That's right Timmy, you get two, count'um, two functions for the price of one! Now that's a steal

## But mister, how'll I keep it safe if I close the web application?

Never you worry Timmy, this application uses the power of local storage to keep all your information for you, without even needing those pesky cookies!

## Wow mister, tell me more!

Since you asked so nicely Timmy! I started this application through the faaar off website of Codecademy and I brought it here to my Github page. I tinkered with it some and got it singing just like a song!

1. I added the ability to remove appointments and contacts through a new component RemoveButton
2. I added checkboxes instead of a dropdown menu so that you can add multiple contacts to the same event.
3. I added local storage.

## But mister, what would you do to improve it?

I'm so glad you asked!

1. I would add the ability to add a contact through the appointment page if they are currently not already in your contact list.
2. I would snazzy it up a bit with more CSS.
3. I would add the ability to contact contacts through the app itself

## Running

It's a react app so you must have node and NPM installed.

To install this app simply run:

```
npm install
```

Then to run it:

```
npm start
```

## Wow, jee wilikers mister, but how'll I use it if I'm a figment of your imagination?

Ooohh Timmy, that's for the courts to decide!
